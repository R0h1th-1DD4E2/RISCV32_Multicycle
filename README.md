# RISC-V Digital Design Projects

This repository contains our implementations inspired by the book  
**"Digital Design and Computer Architecture: RISC-V Edition"** by **David Money Harris** and **Sarah L. Harris**.

These projects aim to apply and extend concepts from the book into practical digital designs, ranging from basic components to system-level architectures.
